### Lesson Content

> [!TIP]- Describe Specific Instructions
> Be specific about your instructions. Make sure the rules are clear and concise:
> ---
> > 1. Everyone in the group must contribute
> > 2. Conversations with other groups should not be taking place
> > 3. I will give directions as we go. Please be listening for further instructions
---
#### Discovery

> You have been given a shape on your board

> Your job is to move that shape based on my instructions

> Pay attention to how each move affects your shape

#### What did we find?

What are [[Glossary of Terms#Rigid Transformations|Rigid Transformations]]?
> Ridge transformations change the:
> >Shape
> >Position
> >NOT the size

---

Types of [[Glossary of Terms#Rigid Transformations|Rigid Transformations]]:
> Rotations
> Translations
> Reflections 

---

>[!NOTE]- Extension
> [[Glossary of Terms#Non-Rigid Transformations|Non-Rigid Transformations]] include dilations which result in the same shape but not same size.

#### Transformations on the coordinate plane

> What happens to coordinates when they undergo transformations?

>Work at your table with your groups using your tracing paper and the coordinate plane to determine if there are any patterns.

---

o   Students use coordinate plane and tracing paper to complete transformations and note coordinates.

o   Think Pair Share

§  How does a transformation affect coordinates?

§  How does changing coordinates cause a transformation?

§  Is there a common formula we can use?

o   Have at least one member of each group share out.

Practice and Apply

·         Individual Work: Delta Math

·         Close with take-a-ways

o   Rigid transformations are the changes in position of a shape.

o   Moving to the right and/or up increases the value of coordinates

o   Moving to the left/down decreases the value of coordinates

**End**

Assessment

·         Assess using exit ticket (Summative)

o   Write the steps to produce the transformation shown: (Drawn on board)

### Follow-up

> [!EXAMPLE]- Enrichment

> [!EXAMPLE]- Reinforcement

> [!EXAMPLE]- Remediation

### Grouping

Students are assigned semi-permanent groups (changed regularly) based on the following criteria in this order of priority:
1.    Roster order sorted by S1 grade.
2.    Personality/behavior

Students have been assigned groups of 2-3 people. If a group is missing 1 or 2 people, it may be combined with another group to create a group of up to 3 people.

Students will be instructed to take the roles of:
·         Scribe (writes on the board)
·         Crier (describes what is on the board)
·         Sage (facilitates the conversation and provides insight)

These roles will rotate regularly during the group work phase, and are also used at student tables to define roles for think-pair-share activities.
