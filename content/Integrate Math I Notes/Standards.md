## M1.G.CO.A.5
Given a geometric figure and a rigid motion, draw the image of the figure in multiple ways, including technology. Specify a sequence of rigid motions that will carry a given figure onto another.

## M1.G.CO.B.6
Use geometric descriptions of rigid motions to transform figures and to predict the effect of a given rigid motion on a given figure; given two figures, use the definition of congruence in terms of rigid motions to determine informally if they are congruent.
